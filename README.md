# Python Project: Statistical Package

## üìñ Project Overview
A statistical package is a collection of software routines designed to simplify statistical analysis and related tasks such as data management. This project implements a statistical package using Python and its libraries.

## üìö Modules Used
### Math Module
Provides access to mathematical functions defined by the C standard.

### NumPy Module
- Python library for working with arrays.
- Created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant.
- Used for vectorized operations in this project.

## üíª System Implementation

### Hardware Used
- **Model:** DELL Inspiron 15300
- **Manufacturer:** DELL Technologies

### Software Used
- **Anaconda (Python distribution):**
  - A distribution of Python and R for scientific computing.
  - Suitable for data science, machine learning, large-scale data processing, and predictive analysis.
  - Includes data science packages for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## üõ†Ô∏è Functions Built

1. **min()** - Returns the minimum value from a list.
2. **max()** - Returns the maximum value from a list.
3. **sum()** - Returns the sum of elements in a list.
4. **fsum()** - Provides an accurate floating-point sum of values.
   - **Difference from `sum()`:** `fsum()` ensures higher floating accuracy and always returns a float.
5. **mean()** - Computes the mean of a range of numbers.
6. **geo_mean()** - Calculates the Geometric Mean.
7. **har_mean()** - Computes the Harmonic Mean.
8. **median()** - Returns the middle value of a dataset.
9. **median_low()** - Finds the lower median in a dataset.
10. **median_high()** - Finds the upper median in a dataset.
11. **mode()** - Returns the most frequent value in a dataset.
12. **variance()** - Measures the spread between numbers in a dataset.
13. **dev()** and **sdev()** - Calculates standard deviation.
14. **covariance()** and **scovariance()** - Measures the relationship between two variables.
15. **correlation()** - Computes the correlation coefficient.
16. **maxvalue()** - Returns the item with the highest value.
17. **minvalue()** - Returns the item with the lowest value.
